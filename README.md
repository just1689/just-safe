# Just Safe

The goal of this project is to provide a self-hosted password manager.

## What I would like the project to achieve

- Trustless. Deploy to the cloud without having to trust your cloud provider.
- Secure. Use sound encryption libraries and techniques.
- Unopinionated about where you hosting. Local or cloud.
- Extensible through an API.


## Phase 1

A secure stateless service containerized with a cloud storage client.

## Phase 2

Web application

## Phase 3

Chrome, Firefox extensions
